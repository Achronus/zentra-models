# Zentra Models

_ðŸ”œ Coming soon! ðŸ”œ_

Zentra Models allows you to build React components using Python.

It uses [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models under-the-hood and focuses on utilising pre-built components to help you build your frontend structure faster.

It aims to be a flexible package that covers a variety of component libraries, while centering around the [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs) framework.
